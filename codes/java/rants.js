document.write('The RIAA can kiss my ass. Sorry, that\'s just the way I feel right now. No, I haven\'t quite been affected by them just yet. I haven\'t used KaZaA in a while to actually be committed of any crime just yet. What bothers me is the report of a 12 year old girl, in New York, who is apparently getting sued by the RIAA. A FRICKIN 12 year old girl. She\'s an honor student, an honest student. Not just that, she\'s a PAYING Customer. Her mother pays KaZaA some odd amount of money just to let her daughter download some music. I think they should countersue the RIAA for harrassing paying customers!!!<br><br>Why does this bother me? I\'m a musician, I have a right for others to hear my music. I watched VH1 earlier today, and I saw how these musicians are living the royal life. They pretty much make normal everyday people look like scum. They pour out their own money just to flaunt others of their \'So-called\' importance. Music was MEANT TO BE PLAYED, NOT PAID!!!<br><br>On a similiar note, you might have heard that Universal \(records?\) are slashing prices of their music. That means that we won\'t be paying SOOO much money like 20 dollars for one CD. For once, they are finally making an alternative to appeal to the customer, rather than suing us for listening to their music. I think that we need to write a HUGE letter of thanks from the local community that we appreciate their support, rather than turning against the fan. Thank you Universal! I\'m going to look forward to buy your CDs!</b>');
