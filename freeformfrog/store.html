            <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS" color="#800000"><b>Ok, 
              so</b><strong> Freeform </strong><b>Frog is somewhat of an abstract title. 
              That's ok. That is because this store is somewhat of an abstract 
              store. It is hosted online by a third party (cafepress.com), and the items up for 
              sale have yet to be made. We at tsn make the logos and images, 
            based on your feedback in the forums. We then upload the graphics to 
            a specific item, and when you purchase your item, they make 
              it and send it to you.</b></font></p>
            <p><b><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS" color="#800000">The name was 
              suggested to me as an available nickname when I tried to enter a 
              chat room. It coincided with the new logo for this site, and I liked 
              the concept. So now it is the name of our online store.</font></b></p>
            <p><b><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS" color="#800000">This is just 
              the beginning though. Once we find out how well this store goes 
              over, we will expand the items that are available for purchase, 
              and hopefully, by next year, will be able to design and host our 
              own online store. For those of you that know me personally, you 
              know that this type of thing is what I have been working on doing 
              ever since our first endeavourer with a college-student-run website. 
              So, naturally, this site has big plans, and there is now nothing 
              to hinder its development, but maybe finances. (But we will worry 
              about that later.)</font></b></p>
            <p><b><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS" color="#800000">The store will 
              be open for business on a date, to-be-announced, during the summer 
            or fall. 
              As of right now, we are not planning on making any profit off the 
              items for sale so you will have the lowest price available. Perhaps 
              when things work out better, we will be able to get a couple more 
              stores and offer more items. Until then, enjoy.</font></b></p>
