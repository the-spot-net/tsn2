    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">And so as I said in the 
    forums, here is the Journal entry that will span the entire weekend, and Monday 
    and Tuesday.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">On Friday, I worked. It 
    was kinda busy, and I made more money than I had made so far. It was about $88 
    that I got to keep in credit cards and cash tips. Pretty good money, I think. 
    When I got home, I played around on the internet, probably in the Anime-kingdom.net&#39;s 
    IRC chat room. Benji and I have been hanging out in there a lot lately. So I 
    went to bed about 3:00 a.m.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I wanted to sleep in some, 
    even though I had to work in the morning. But while I was asleep, I thought 
    I heard my dad yell my name from downstairs, and got up to go see what he wanted. 
    He didn&#39;t say anything. But since I was up, we had to move some things from 
    upstairs to downstairs before I went to work anyway, so I stayed awake to help 
    him. We didn&#39;t finish as early as I thought we might, so when we were done, 
    I just took my shower, and went to work. It was pretty slow there, but I was 
    tired and my feet were sore. I just wanted to go home and sleep. When I did 
    finally get off work, I went home, but wasn&#39;t able to sleep. I was volunteered 
    to help paint the game room, which was why we had to move the stuff out of it. 
    I was very reluctant to do so because I just wanted to sleep. But I did anyway.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I did get to take a small 
    nap while we were letting the paint dry, and while the parents cooked dinner. 
    After dinner, I played some Unreal Tournament, and found that I am getting my 
    skills back. I went to the Thrift store on Friday too, and bought some joysticks 
    to play UT with, but I didn&#39;t get them to work until Monday. While I was at 
    the Thrift store, I also got two Hawaiian shirts, and a cell phone with no service...all 
    for $12.02. Pretty good deal.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Sunday morning, I was 
    awakened at 9:04, an hour before I wanted to be woken up, because we were going 
    to IHOP for breakfast before I went back to work. So I got coffee to drink while 
    I was there. At work, it was kinda busy, but I didn&#39;t make any spectacular amount 
    of money. In fact, I claimed $20 more than I really had for taxes, since I forgot 
    to take my bank out of my cash that I had. So I just won&#39;t claim the $20 over 
    the next two days.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I went to church that 
    night, and sat with Natalie. I hadn&#39;t done that in a while, and she hadn&#39;t been 
    there often to do it. So I did. But we didn&#39;t do anything after church. According 
    to some of the people there, Alana was the one that usually planned the things 
    that we did after church. I don&#39;t see why someone else can&#39;t plan what we do...especially 
    since Alana isn&#39;t here anymore to do it. But I already had other plans, so I 
    didn&#39;t bother. Maybe next time. My Nonnie and Papa were in town to celebrate 
    their birthdays before they go on their trip to Aruba in September. So we went 
    to Buck&#39;n Loon&#39;s and I got my discount this time. I also hooked them up with 
    a chocolate sundae, but I couldn&#39;t get the waiters to sing, because they were 
    busy.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Monday, I started school 
    again, and it felt weird. I hadn&#39;t been to school in a while, and it was different 
    this time, than it was last time. This time I came into the school with my palm-pilot 
    and started taking notes on it right off the bat. I also have to psyche myself 
    up to be in these classes with these people for a whole semester. I did find 
    someone in my Government class that I used to work with at Braum&#39;s - Dee. He&#39;s 
    pretty cool, and I will have to tell Stacy next time I talk to her, that Dee 
    was in my government class. I wore a bright red Hawaiian Shirt to the first 
    day of class, so that the teachers would notice me, and I sat in the front row. 
    It worked, because one of them said hi to me after class, because he recognized 
    me.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">In Spanish class, I was 
    surprised at how much I remembered, but also at how much I thought I had a grasp 
    on...like verb forms. Blah. Smurf the verb forms. But I didn&#39;t get anything 
    wrong when we did our exercises in class. However there was this one Spanish 
    speaking girl that couldn&#39;t quite say the right things in Spanish. What a loser.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">And then there is my Microsoft 
    Office XP class...which is going to be the biggest royal waste of my time I 
    have ever engaged in. And the worst thing about it is if I don&#39;t pay attention, 
    I won&#39;t be able to do what he wants; he&#39;ll say something and I will miss out 
    on what he wants to do. Otherwise, I would site in class, and work on my website. 
    I still might take notes on the site, in the notes forum, but I don&#39;t know if 
    I really need to take notes.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After school, I worked 
    out a schedule to do all my homework, and sleep and eating, (which right now 
    I should be asleep, and not on the internet) and am having a hard time keeping 
    to my schedule right now. I managed to work with it this morning, and got all 
    the homework that was scheduled to be done, finished this morning before work. 
    I still have one information paper to write but it isn&#39;t due until Thursday 
    anyway, so I can do it tomorrow morning. It is for Economics. This class is 
    going to be difficult, because the professor wanders around the room, and has 
    an accent, and he mumbles. It&#39;s difficult.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">On another note, I posted 
    a picture to <a href="http://www.hotornot.com">www.hotornot.com</a>, and in 
    two days, I have acquired 72 votes, and have a rating of 8.3 out of 10, with 
    10 being HOT, and 1 being NOT. So I am hotter than 80% of the men posted on 
    that site. I thought it was interesting. I always wondered what girls liked 
    about me...apparently I am some kind of cute. Eh...that&#39;s cool.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Anyway, I need to be getting 
    to bed now. I didn&#39;t really even want to write this tonight. So, due to my schedule, 
    I will be doing these, um...let&#39;s say as often as I can, but at LEAST once a 
    week. So if it is not up in the morning, when you wake up, then just check back 
    the next morning. Laterz.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I didn&#39;t feel like writing 
    a journal yesterday. But I will write one today that briefly describes yesterday 
    and today.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">So yesterday was Alana&#39;s 
    last day before she went to college for the first time. All her friends (albeit 
    they were high school students) were acting like she was dying and they would 
    never see her again. Stupid kids. Anyway, I tried to convince her and her friends, 
    that it&#39;s not as big a deal as everyone was making it out to be. She&#39;ll enjoy 
    college, and probably won&#39;t want to come home for a while - I know I did/didn&#39;t.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After church last night, 
    we went to Sarah and Jeff&#39;s house and watched Final Destination 2. It was a 
    pretty freaky movie. It&#39;s a good thing that Benji told us about the graphicness 
    in the forums about the movie, before I got it...otherwise I would have been 
    totally grossed out by how much detail they showed. I was a little edgy on the 
    way home, but I didn&#39;t even think about it today at all. (Unlike the first one, 
    where it bothered me for the next day or two.) </font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Today, I slept in until 
    12:00 or so. This has become a common occurrence for me the past couple days. 
    It will have to stop soon, because of school starting. Which, by they way, I 
    am both looking forward to, and not, on Monday. This will be something interesting 
    for me, having night classes, and a job willing to work with my school schedule.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Tonight at work, it was 
    pretty slow for most of the night. I got my gratuity that was taken out of that 
    party on Tuesday...it was $28, so now I don&#39;t feel so bad. I made $33 off that 
    table, which is the most I have made from one table so far. And I made about 
    $35 tonight, but since it was slow, that is decent. One table was three &quot;city-hick&quot; 
    type people, and they left no tip, even after we bent the rules to they could 
    get what they wanted to eat, in a way we don&#39;t serve it. I was disgusted with 
    &quot;city-hick&quot; type people after that. </font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">But the thing that most 
    bothered me was a lady and her kid that came in at 10:35...right before we were 
    about to put up the chairs and close up. She came in and ordered Catfish, and 
    her kid got a hamburger. The Catfish is the thing that takes the longest to 
    cook. So then she eats a little bit, and her kids eats some...then the kid stops 
    eating, and goes to play video games. She has brought a book along with her 
    to read. And she does...as she talks on her cell phone, while stand there, discussing 
    whether or not their dog will eat the French fries if she brings them home with 
    her. She decides that it will, so I bring the box for them, and get her bill 
    and payment, and leave her change. About 30 minutes later, she wants more tartar 
    sauce. The kitchen is already closed, and I told her this. &quot;Oh, ok...don&#39;t worry 
    about it then...&quot; (Ok, I won&#39;t.) So they are there from 10:30 until 11:45. I 
    don&#39;t get to leave until 12:00. Stupid people.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Anyway, it&#39;s nearly 3:00,

    than that, I just tried to take a couple naps. I went to the bank and put money 
    into my account because apparently I have overdrawn (according to my records) 
    $13. So I put in $75.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Not much happened today 
    so this is going to be short. I went to work at about 4:30, and was in the party 
    room...this means that I only get the parties. So I didn&#39;t get a table until 
    6:00. Boring! I stood around until then, and talked with the hostess, since 
    she didn&#39;t have much to do either. Tuesdays are pretty slow in general. When 
    my party came, they had this special deal where they get their burgers for $5 
    and some other special circumstances. That was fine with me, except that every 
    time I tried to bring them their ticket, they ordered something else. So I had 
    to get the manager to take off a little more money each time. It was not worth 
    it. I only made $5 on the table from cash/credit tips. But there is supposed 
    to be some kind of gratuity added to my paycheck for this one, since there was 
    no tax, and there was no gratuity on it. But I don&#39;t know how much it was.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After that one party, 
    they let me go home. So I didn&#39;t make hardly any money at all last night, so 
    far. Sigh...if I don&#39;t start making more money when the school season gets underway,

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I got up early this morning, 
    reluctantly because I was tired, to go to Plano to visit with Amy once more 
    before she went back to Kilgore to start school on Wednesday. When I got there, 
    her brother and his friend, Nick, were playing Mortal Combat on Nintendo Gamecube, 
    so we watched them do that for a while. Then we watched Bringin&#39; Down the House. 
    It was a long movie, and could have ended sooner, and that would have been fine 
    with me. When it was over, Amy and I went to Dave &amp; Buster&#39;s and played some 
    pool. It was fun, and did bring back a couple old memories of the college days. 
    I realized also that I haven&#39;t lost my touch, just gotten a little rusty on 
    my trick shots and combinations. I do need to work on that, and now that I know 
    where the place is, and how to get there, I can do things like that when ever. 
    (I used to think that going to Plano was a special event because it was so &quot;far,&quot; 
    but an hour is not really far (for me at least)) Next time she and I hang out, 
    I&#39;ll have her come to Arlington so we can do things here. There is a little 
    more to do here than there is there.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Well, after pool, we went 
    back to the apartment, and watched a little TV, and decided to take a nap. I 
    was sleepy because I haven&#39;t gotten much sleep with all the new events taking 
    place on the site, and getting off of work so late. Then I came back at 8:00 
    and got home at 9:00. I made myself a BBQ Beef Sandwich, and called Alana, but 
    I never got a return call, and she didn&#39;t come online. Eh...oh well. I&#39;ll see 
    her tomorrow or something. I found out that I don&#39;t work on Wednesday like I 
    thought, so I can spend that night with her before she goes off to college.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I also talked with Lauren 
    about her guy-issues and coping with friends leaving for college. I think that 
    she was glad to hear someone take interest in giving her their point of view 
    about things...but then again, I don&#39;t know what she felt, because she ended 
    the conversation rather abruptly with &quot;I have to go, I have homework.&quot; So, I 
    dunno.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Ahh, Sunday. I had to 
    get up at 10:00 this morning to go to work at 11:00. It was slow at first, but 
    then it was pretty steady. I still didn&#39;t make much money today though I only 
    made $40, with $18 in cash. I did get my side work done pretty quick though, 
    since I got smart and did it as I went along. I was also excited to see that 
    I am making progress with some of the people at work. There are a couple of 
    them that are still shy to talk to me, and I have been given signals that at 
    least 2 of them today don&#39;t mind talking anymore. I was shocked when one of 
    the girls (who rarely says anything to me) walked by and patted my hand, which 
    was no where near being in her path of movement - it was actually resting on 
    my stomach, and my side was turned to her as she walked. Oh well. She has warm, 
    and soft hands, and I tried not to think too much about it - and I didn&#39;t.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After work I was supposed 
    to have dinner with my parents tonight, but they didn&#39;t get back from shopping 
    in time to have it done when I got home, so I had tuna fish sandwiches. Then 
    I went to church, but only after I stopped by the Diamond Shamrock and got a 
    Monster Energy drink, so I wouldn&#39;t fall asleep in church. The last couple times 
    I have gone to church after working, I have had an incredibly hard time staying 
    awake in church, even on the second row. This time, there was no problem, and 
    I had enough energy to spare until now (2:15 a.m.).</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After church we went to 
    Chili&#39;s and I got some Boneless Buffalo Wings. They were salty and nasty. I 
    was very disappointed in them. I guess I should have gotten the real ones with 
    the bones. I was mainly disappointed because they cost $6, and I didn&#39;t get 
    as many as I thought I would get. But I had a good time with everyone. When 
    we were done eating, we took the high school kids home, and the college kids 
    went to Sarah&#39;s house and watched Forrest Gump. I got to the part where he just 
    finishes running across America, and then I had to leave.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I talked with Amy tonight, 
    (as well as Benji, Alana, Melinda (who I don&#39;t know)) and I will be going to 
    Plano tomorrow, since she is leaving Tuesday. I&#39;m gonna spend one more day with 
    her before she leaves for a while due to school. I also got on the site, and 
    found that there were 9 new posts this time, and they just kept coming for the 
    next 2 hours. The three biggest posters (me, UPS, and Spiffy) were online posting 
    replies to each other&#39;s messages. In all we had 31 posts tonight, which has 
    to be some kind of new record. I don&#39;t recall ever having that many new posts 
    in one session. This makes the average 5 posts a day, with an average of 1 new 
    topic a day. There are 622 posts, and 128 topics now.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I mentioned Melinda. I 
    don&#39;t know who she is, but for some reason she was on my ETBU list, but she 
    has never gone to ETBU, and isn&#39;t going to. She is working on going to UT Arlington. 
    Dah well...I will talk with her more when she comes online again. I showed her 
    the site, and shortly afterward, she signed offline, without warning. So I don&#39;t 
    know how she took it. Anyway, that is all for tonight. I need my sleep so I 
    can get up early tomorrow morning. Laterz.</font></b></p>

    this morning. I was confused when I got up this morning, since I am used to 
    getting up at 12:00. But outside it looked very bright. I thought it was 7:30 
    in the evening, and realized that I must have taken a nap, and jumped out of 
    bed to go do something, but realized that I am up way earlier than I am used 
    to.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I got ready and left the 
    house about 8:45 and got to Amy&#39;s about 9:45. I didn&#39;t have any problems with 
    the directions that I got off the internet, because I didn&#39;t use them. Instead, 
    my dad gave me directions that he uses to get to his work, which is slightly 
    quicker, and uses the airport, and not the residential streets from yahoo&#39;s 
    map.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">When I got there, she 
    hadn&#39;t even gotten up yet. So I waited about 10 minutes for her to get ready 
    and then we went to Dave &amp; Buster&#39;s in Stonebrier Mall. We played this Cyclone 
    game where the lights go around the circle, and if you hit the button when it 
    is in a certain area, then you win the jackpot. I won 3 times, but each time, 
    the lights went either forward or backward one space. It cheated! Figures...it 
    was for 500 tickets, on both machines. I could have gotten 1,000 tickets had 
    they let me. Fags.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">We didn&#39;t have time for 
    many games since they didn&#39;t open until 11:30 and we had to go to lunch at 12:00 
    at a place called the Purple Cow. It was a hamburger diner like Steak&#39;n Shake. 
    Her family all got milk shakes because they all believed that those were the 
    best milk shakes they have ever had. I got tea, because I have made the best 
    milk shakes ever had, and don&#39;t care to have anymore.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">When lunch was over, we 
    went back to the apartment, and played a little bit of Nintendo Gamecube - Mortal 
    Kombat. It was interesting. At first, I lost all the game against her brother, 
    but then I started to figure out what all the buttons did, and beat him the 
    last couple times I played him. Well, her brother and his friend soon left to 
    go swimming and stuff with friends, so she and I just hung out and watched TV 
    until it was time for me to go.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">While we were watching 
    TV, we saw that Tiger mascot that ETBU had adopted for their pet on Animal Planet. 
    We were surprised that it was on there...but then moved on to more important 
    things than the tiger. At 3:00 I had to leave, and made it home about 4:15, 
    to go to work tonight.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I got home with time to 
    spare, so I had some biscuits. Work tonight was extremely slow. I didn&#39;t get 
    a table until 6:00 because we had a soccer team of kids coming in at that time, 
    and the whole side of the restaurant was reserved. Then I also closed tonight, 
    but still didn&#39;t make many tips since we were so slow. From 10:30 until 12:00, 
    I did not get a single table. I just stood around and did nothing. So after 
    work I came home, ate some hot dogs, and got online to see that there were 8 
    new posts while I was gone. So I check them, chatted with Benji, and posted 
    more on the site. And now I go back to bed, because I have to get up and go 
    back to work tomorrow morning. It stinks. I hope it is not boring, and that 
    I get cash tips. I need them. Laterz.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Today is Friday. Though 
    it felt like a Monday. I finally went back to work today, but not after I lounged 
    around the house for a good couple hours. When I woke up this morning, I was 
    hoping for a call from at least one of two people, but I didn&#39;t get either one 
    of them. So I laid in bed until about 12:00, when I then got up, and said to 
    my phone, &quot;Why don&#39;t you ring?&quot; At that instant it did...but it was for my step-sister 
    who does not live here anymore. Ugh...so I started to do something constructive 
    and cleaned my room. I found a credit card bill that I hadn&#39;t paid yet, and 
    got that taken care of, which means that I have less money in my account that 
    I thought I would for tomorrow. That&#39;s ok though, because I go to work tonight 
    and get paid some more cash.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I called Amy, who had 
    forgotten...(every time she always forgets that she is going to call me, and 
    I end up calling her). We decided that I am going to drive to Plano tomorrow 
    morning, and we will hang out there. Though I still do not know what we are 
    going to do while we are there, other than the very minimal planned activities 
    that we have already hinted at.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I tried to work on some 
    more products for my online store, but I just wasn&#39;t feeling them when I was 
    doing it. Things weren&#39;t going very smoothly, so I decided to put it off for 
    a little while, when I have more time. I did get the menus and other things 
    working for the site though, so I did make some progress.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I went to work, and it 
    started out slow. Then it kind of picked up, at least in my section, and then 
    it dropped off as suddenly as it picked up. I made about $70 tonight though, 
    plus another $10 that I didn&#39;t get to keep, since it went to Tip Share. But 
    that is good for my bills...now I don&#39;t have to worry so much about not having 
    any money at all.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I got to work with both 
    Audra and Amie...both of which, when combined, would resemble an exact copy 
    of Amy that I am seeing tomorrow. I enjoy working with Audra, since she is friendly 
    to me, though Amie is not so friendly. Her and Sean (who I think resembles me 
    in a way) are hooked up, and I am often reminded about how things went with 
    Amy and I when we were in that situation. It was interesting to say the least.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Anyway, I got to take 
    home 10 biscuits for $0.96 tonight, plus my $30 in cash tips. So I was feeling 
    pretty good about tonight. I get to do it all again tomorrow night though too. 
    I was pretty bummed though that Bry, one of the managers, wouldn&#39;t let me use 
    my Palm-Pilot to take orders like I did on Sunday night. It works pretty well, 
    but he says that it is not the way that everyone else is doing it, so I can&#39;t 
    do it. It&#39;s all right though...I was only doing it so that I could get some 
    use out of it since it cost me so much...but when school starts in 9 days, it 
    will get plenty of use taking notes and such.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">That&#39;s all I have for 
    tonight. I need to get to bed now, since I have to wake up in 4.5 hours, and 
    cut my hair, and iron my clothes so I can get ready to go to&nbsp; Plano. Yea!

    the bathroom, and deposited my paycheck, and then went skating. I wanted to 
    go skating, and I did. It was relaxing, and would have been more so if my skates 
    would have fit. My rollerblades are three sizes too small...so it wasn&#39;t such 
    a great feeling. But I enjoyed it nonetheless.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Afterward, I took a trip 
    up to TCC to see about my books and getting them bought. I was right about my 
    Business Computer Applications class...it was a $161 book for Office XP. Let&#39;s 
    see. I was a wiz at Office before XP came out, and I have been using Office 
    XP in particular for nearly a year now - even before it went on the market. 
    I don&#39;t think I need this class. And buying my other two books almost broke 
    me: $500 in all for all four books.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">So I was pretty bummed 
    about that. I only have $50 in my account and that is going to go to bills...paying 
    off the minimum payments on my credit cards, because I can&#39;t afford anything 
    more. *sigh* This sucks. I made some hamburgers tonight for dinner, and I enjoyed 
    that though. Then I went to hang out with the youth group at one of their houses, 
    and we watched I Am Sam. I have already seen it, but it was still a pretty good 
    movie.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Amy got in to Plano sometime 
    tonight, and I am to expect her call tomorrow morning, so we can do something 
    on Saturday. I haven&#39;t talked to her since last night though. She didn&#39;t come 
    online tonight. I guess she doesn&#39;t have an internet connection at her brother&#39;s 
    place. Oh well...I am pumped about hanging with her. Though I don&#39;t know what 
    we are going to do.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Alana goes to college 
    in a couple days, and she is kinda bummed about leaving her friends, and moving 
    to a new school. I know that I was excited to leave home and meet new people. 
    I was ready to go to college...and I made the most of the social life that I 
    could while I was there, because the classes weren&#39;t challenging to me. Now 
    though, I am taking different types of classes. Government and Economics will 
    be studiers, as well as Spanish. But this stupid Office XP class is going to 
    be my easy A, and blow off class. Though I am still going to do the work, and 
    probably do it all ahead of time.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Anyway, I have posted 
    several pages to the site tonight, including the images for the online store, 
    and a favorite links page for our partners in crime. I&#39;ll be working on new 
    products for the store, once I get the rest of the pages up for the site which 
    isn&#39;t many more. I also need to start production of the new Radio section. I 
    think I will use green for that part, but I don&#39;t really want to go through 
    the process of making all the small images required to create a functional banner 
    like I have on all the pages. But it is necessary to provide a cool site, which

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Today was rain. There 
    was not just rain, but Rain. I went to TCC and did my financial aid stuff. I 
    had to wait in line for about an hour to get my degree audit request form and 
    turn it back in. I also went to a college book store, to see if they had a book 
    that TCC was out of for my, what I consider to be, a blow off computer class. 
    From the name of it, it appears to be an Microsoft Office class. And if that 
    is so, then I will be basically teaching that class since I am capable of doing 
    anything I want to do in Microsoft Office. *sigh* I wish I could just clep out 
    of it. But it will be an easy A and will count toward my GPA which is what I 
    need...some easy As that count.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I got my paycheck today 
    too...and they took a bunch of stuff out of it that I didn&#39;t plan on...though 
    I was surprised to see that my calculations on my spreadsheet, taking into consideration 
    the taxes that I thought they were going to take out, were correct as to how 
    much I was going to get on my check. Oh well, I will count the uniform expenses 
    as non-reimbursed business expenses and they can be tax credits. However, I 
    failed to remember to bring some deposit slips with me when I went to the bank, 
    and I don&#39;t know my account number, so I couldn&#39;t deposit my check today...it 
    was near 5:00 when I got there...and only the drive thru was open. So I will 
    just do it tomorrow.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Tomorrow I also have to 
    clean my bathroom and bedroom, and now go to the bank, and also buy my books 
    for class. I hope I have enough money to pay for it all...because I really don&#39;t 
    want to have to put anything else on my charge card. As it stands I will have 
    them all paid off in a little over a year. But I don&#39;t know if I can make the 
    planned payments that I have put in Microsoft Money to figure that out. We&#39;ll 
    see. It sucks that I have had to get myself in debt. But that could have been 
    slightly avoided if I hadn&#39;t had to pay the taxes on the car that I got from 
    my parents. It could have just been given to me as a gift. But I don&#39;t really 
    have to deal with them anymore now, so I don&#39;t care. That money though was set 
    aside for paying for my palm-pilot, but now I don&#39;t have it anymore, and it 
    is going to take me a while to get it back. I would get a second job, but school 
    is starting and I can&#39;t do all three. I really hope that I can do a job and 
    school this time. I will have to. I need the money. Stupid money.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After all this, I went 
    to church tonight, and we didn&#39;t have a conventional quarterly study (which 
    was good, because I don&#39;t like having lessons from a book.) Instead we did a 
    little praise and worship and then examined the state of the college/youth group...and 
    tried to come up with ideas or how to make it grow, and get the people back 
    in church that left when the youth minister did. It seems that they were only 
    here because of the fun and games that we did after church...but it could have 
    also been that the group just didn&#39;t include them in their activities outside 
    of the church when everyone else did something. I guess I got lucky and was 
    included. But it wouldn&#39;t have mattered to me, I would have hung out with Natalie 
    anyway.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After church, we all went 
    out to eat at Buck&#39;n Loon&#39;s. I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t give me a discount...they 
    should have. Maybe it is if everything is on one ticket, then they do it. I 
    dunno. But afterward, we all split up, and Lauren, Alana, and I went to Alana&#39;s 
    house to watch &quot;What a girl wants&quot; with Amanda Bynes. It was a decent movie...but 
    I think Amanda Bynes is cute so it doesn&#39;t matter how the movie goes. Then I 
    came home and found out that a bunch of new people have joined the site, and 
    a bunch of posts have been made. We even got a new record as to how many people 
    there were online at one time on the 12th. I was excited. So I unveiled the 
    plans for a radio station, and hope to see some interest in it. But that is 
    going to have to be all tonight, since it is 3:10 a.m. and I need to sleep so 
    I can get things done tomorrow. Laterz.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">We went to the lake today...Possum 
    Kingdom, instead of Joe Pool, like I thought I was going to. But it was all 
    right. The thing that I didn&#39;t enjoy was riding with Alana. She scares ME of 
    all people when she drives. I like to go slightly over the speed limit, but 
    I don&#39;t swerve or anything...she goes the speed limit, but has a hard time driving 
    straight. It&#39;s almost like riding with my step-dad, who, though he is an experienced 
    driver, tends to go from middle of the lane to the shoulder stripe, but doesn&#39;t 
    over correct himself when he moves back to the lane. It was something else.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">When we got to the lake, 
    we went out on a boat that we rented, and tubed around for about 3 hours. It 
    was fun, and though I hadn&#39;t done it in about 5 years or so, I did it 3 times, 
    and fell off 2 of 3 times. I was pretty tired after trying to get back on the 
    inner tube from the water, and from all the thinking involved in trying to stay 
    on the inner tube when the waves are coming. It&#39;s complicated.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">So, in doing this, I met 
    some teenagers (yes, though they are 18, they are younger than I, and teenagers 
    still) today that Alana graduated with this past May. Also, Lauren, from church 
    came with us. This was a chance for Alana, Lauren and I to get to know each 
    other better, and we did just that. After we did the tubing, we went for a swim 
    in a cove called Hell&#39;s Gates, though I am not quite sure why it is called that, 
    since it was not hot, shallow, or wavy/windy. I dunno...just a name I guess. 
    Then we came back home, and went out to eat at Mercado Juarez. In all, today 
    cost me about $50 that I didn&#39;t have to spare, but wasn&#39;t told about before 
    hand when I agreed to go on the trip. *sigh*...I hope I make it up this Friday 
    when I go back to work. I still have to buy two books for school, and get my 
    loan applications from the college. I guess I will be doing that tomorrow.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I talked to my friend 
    Amy again tonight, and we shared in deep conversation about stuff...just like 
    every night. I am glad she is coming to hang with me on Saturday...as is she 
    also glad. We haven&#39;t seen each other in about 8 months, and am surprised that 
    we are still talking as though we had. But I only have about 4 friends from 
    college that I can talk to like that: Amy, Benji, Jay, and Beth. The rest of 
    my friends, I rarely ever talk to online, except for the ones that post in the 
    forums. I like my friends, I just wish we could talk more about things that 
    we had in common. I may take that challenge to heart, and start talking to some 
    of the people that I haven&#39;t talked to in a while soon. Anyway, that is all 
    for tonight, other than to mention the crazy thunderstorms that we are going 
    to be having until Thursday. It&#39;s insane to have rain like this in August. Laterz.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Not much happened today...at 
    least not to me. I went to the library this afternoon at about 2:15, and dropped 
    off my Alice in Wonderland book. On the way home, the highway (360) was backed 
    up for about 3 blocks...and it took about 30 minutes before I could get those 
    three blocks to see what was going on. They police had shut down a section of 
    highway, where Pioneer (Spur 303) crosses Highway 360, and there was no traffic 
    north or south bound. The reason: a guy was perched on the ledge of the bridge, 
    prepared to jump. I don&#39;t know if he actually did or not, because at that time, 
    I had gotten passed it. But I assume that he didn&#39;t since it wasn&#39;t on the news, 
    and the highway was opened up later when my stepsister came by the house.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Well, after that ordeal, 
    I went to the Wal-mart and got a new watch band. I felt good about that because 
    now it matches my watch. Eh, I&#39;m weird, ok. So I got home about 4:00. The time 
    I spent in the car was enough for me to have made a trip to Hubbard to visit 
    my mom, who I should write too soon by the way. I just haven&#39;t felt in the mood 
    to write a letter, and haven&#39;t until recently felt like writing a journal. Let&#39;s 
    hope this can be kept up.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I made chicken strips 
    for dinner, with French fries...just like Dairy Queen makes them...though the 
    fries were not the same, and they didn&#39;t quite cook all the way, but they were 
    still good. It rained too tonight, which I was surprised about. After being 
    so hot all day, I am surprised it is raining so much in August. I haven&#39;t seen 
    that in a long time. It was nice.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After dinner, and most 
    of the rain, I went hung out with some of the kids from the youth group at church 
    and watched movies. Then I came back home, talked online to some people (namely 
    Jay and Amy). Amy is coming to see me on Thursday/Friday/Saturday...one of those 
    days. I don&#39;t know which though. But we are both excited about it. We haven&#39;t 
    seen each other since December 22, the day I left ETBU for good. It was a sad 
    experience.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Anyway, that is all for 
    tonight. I am going to the lake tomorrow with Lauren, Alana, and her friends 
    from somewhere. So I&#39;ll let y&#39;all know how that goes. Laterz.</font></b></p>

    since you last heard from me in these journals...so sit back while I engage 
    upon a tale that you will probably forget.</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">From the time that Stacy 
    wrote my last journal entry, until last Monday, her and I were great. Nothing 
    wrong. On that Monday, I made up my mind that I would plan out the whole day 
    for myself, and that would include spending the entire workable day searching 
    for a job at various restaurants (which also turned out to include KSCS Radio 
    station). I would do this until 5:00, or so, at which time I would go swimming 
    at my step-sister&#39;s house. Good plan...do the work and get rewarded at the end 
    of the hot summer day.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I went to all the full 
    service restaurants around the intersection of Hwy 360 and I-30 up near where 
    my step-sister lives, but closer to Six Flags Over Texas. I did this from 11 
    a.m. until 3:45 p.m. at which time I had completed my mission, sooner than I 
    had expected. So, do I want to go swimming now, or should I go and spend some 
    time with Stacy for a little bit? I know, I have a great idea...I will go spend 
    time with her, and then I will take her with me and we&#39;ll go swimming!</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">So, I do that; and we 
    have a blast, playing with a little toy torpedo that we found in the bottom 
    of the pool. Since there was no one in the pool with us for most of the time, 
    we stop playing every once and a while, and sit there and kiss a little bit. 
    Well, towards the end of the swimming time, we were sitting there kissing, and 
    the pool owner (or someone) called the police thinking that we were having &quot;sex!&quot; 
    What the f***? That would be the most absurd thing that I have seen. Anyway, 
    the police ask us to get out of the pool, then ask us questions, and then after 
    about 45 minutes, and a phone call to Stacy&#39;s mom to come get her, they let 
    us go.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">However, we did not get 
    off that easy. Stacy&#39;s mom won&#39;t let her see me, or have any contact with me, 
    regardless of what the truth is, or what anyone says. She won&#39;t even let me 
    talk to her about the situation. So she is grounded from me until she is 18, 
    which is in Sept 2004. But we have decided to wait for each other.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">But in the meantime, I 
    have been enjoying the lost ability to hang out with my friends on a regular 
    basis, and polish up my flirting capabilities that I haven&#39;t had to use in a 
    while.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Now I am a waiter at Buck&#39;n 
    Loon&#39;s here in Arlington. I started the job at the end of July. It&#39;s fun so 
    far, and I enjoy getting to make tips. I still have yet to master the&nbsp; 
    art of getting good tips, but they are decent, with pay ranging from averaging 
    $7-$14 an hour in a night.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I have recently been working 
    on the newest version of the site, as you have seen, and hope to get things 
    together for a radio station and the online store to be released soon. I have
