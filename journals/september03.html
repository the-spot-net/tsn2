    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Normally, I would only 
    have time to do one journal entry per week, but the events of the past 
    couple days (namely Monday and Tuesday) require that I make an &quot;emergency&quot; 
    journal entry, lest they be forgotten by next Sunday.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">This first section is 
    primarily a rant, but I will put it here, since it is most likely that 
    people will not read this as much as they read the Forums. It has to do with 
    a guy that is in my computer class. He came up to me one day and asked if he 
    could sit next to me in class, since normally I am typing away while the 
    teacher is talking - he said it looks like I know what I am doing. Well, I 
    am typing away because I am posting on this site, or typing notes in my 
    palm-pilot. Anyway, over where I sit is just me and Brynn...and now him. It 
    came to my attention yesterday that this kid knows nothing about what he is 
    doing, and has never used even Microsoft Word before. I don't know how he 
    made it to college if he can't use a word processor! We had a test 
    yesterday, and the second part was using Microsoft Word to edit a document, 
    and replicate the one that was projected onto the screen at the head of the 
    classroom. He, first of all, didn't even know how to save it to his hard 
    drive, and second, didn't know how to do ANYTHING in Word - even to make 
    something bold. I told him that I could not help him with this, because that 
    is just too much to explain. I did so because he hasn't done any of his labs 
    that he is supposed to do to teach the people that know nothing how to use 
    Word. I am not going to be his nerd, and I could care less if he fails this 
    class. This is college, and I don't have to do anything for anyone. If he 
    can't hack it, he doesn't need his credit for the class. I don't mind 
    answering difficult questions about the software, but to do the whole 
    project for him in essence...that's not going to happen. He needs to find 
    time to get with the teacher or a tutor outside of class, or he needs to 
    withdrawal from the class.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Secondly, I just 
    learned that one of Stacy's friends (a guy friend) could possibly be working 
    for Buck'n Loon's soon. I am not quite sure how to take it, but from what I 
    hear, I don't think that they are going to hire him. I did find out though 
    that Stacy didn't write me off because of the whole labret piercing 
    deal...though I thought she had, and had considered her to have. We talked 
    briefly when she called, but I didn't have much to say, because I honestly 
    thought that she had ended it with me, and I had begun to move on. But we'll 
    see what happens; she has acquired a couple new guy friends that she goes 
    and does stuff with now...so we'll see.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Thirdly, when I got 
    home last night, we had NO HOT WATER. Apparently the pilot light went out on 
    our water heater, and my dad doesn't know how to fix it. I looked at the 
    instructions, but it said to read the warnings first. I concluded that I 
    would not mess with it, since it is a gas water heater. Now we are waiting 
    for the plumber to come and fix it - or rather I am waiting for the plumber. 
    They have no method of schedule whatsoever. He said &quot;Yeah, we'll be there 
    today.&quot; What? Today? As in between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 11:59 p.m.? 
    Great. So taking a shower was a challenge this morning.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">And fourthly, I have 
    been feeling kind of sick lately. I don't know what it is, but on Friday 
    afternoon, after I woke up from my nap, I immediately had a problem with 
    drainage, and my sinuses. My throat is dry and scratchy, and mucus is 
    covering my vocal cords, so it makes it hard to talk, and causes me to cough 
    a lot. I wish that vinegar would eat away at the mucus, but it doesn't. 
    Nothing does. I'm stuck, and I don't need to go to the doctor for something 
    as small as this, but I don't know what to take to fix it. Oh well.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Oh, yeah. I still 
    haven't gotten my Sega or Soundsystem for my computer from ebay.com yet. I 
    did however get two of the games that I purchased individually 
    yesterday...now if only I could play them.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">This week was very 
    eventful! Let's start at the beginning, though the events may not be 
    entirely in order. In fact, forget the order (because I have) I will just 
    talk about them.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Sometime during the 
    week, my step mom went to the doctor to find out what her ailment was, and 
    they concluded that it was Lymphoma - for those that don't know, it's cancer 
    of the lymph nodes. So she will be starting treatments here in a couple 
    weeks, after they do a biopsy. It has hit my family pretty hard, but I seem 
    to be the only one that is not emotionally affected by it. But then again, I 
    usually take things as they come because that's the way God wants it. I 
    mean, you can pray and try to change his mind, or pray to see if that is 
    what he is wanting you do to (because he hasn't heard from you in a while) 
    and either case is likely. I say that because my parents keep saying that 
    they want to start going back to church, but they don't do anything about 
    it. One is up early enough to go on Sunday mornings, and the other is still 
    asleep. However, I manage to get up, no matter how late I stayed up the 
    night before, and go. That's the worse thing to do, is to get out of the 
    habit of going to church (even if it is just a habit) because then you will 
    get into the habit of not going). If you don't get anything out of church, 
    then continue going until you find one that you enjoy, but don't ever stop.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">On another note, I 
    have been buying some things off of ebay.com lately, and I finally got a 
    couple of them in the mail yesterday. So far, I have gotten an Ethernet card 
    for my palm-pilot, so I can get on the internet at school and on to the 
    network. I also got my Matrix sunglasses, and some software for my 
    palm-pilot. Tons of software. I am still waiting on two Sega Genesis systems 
    with controllers, and about 10-13 games, and also my computer sound system. 
    Those should be here tomorrow and Tuesday.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">This week (or maybe it 
    was last week, I dunno) I rearranged my room. It looks totally different and 
    makes me think that it is something new. Rearranging keeps things 
    interesting. I also did it to make room for the incoming goodies I will be 
    getting soon. And with a little more space organization, I have a lot more 
    space along the walls to put things.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">This Friday, I was 
    supposed to do something with Brynn, and she told me to call her, but when I 
    did, she didn't return my calls. So I went out to eat with my dad, step mom, 
    sister, and Stan - her boyfriend. We had Mexican food, and I got a 20&quot; 
    plate. I ate it all, but the rice. I don't like Mexican rice very much.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Ahh yes, Saturday we 
    spent the entire day in Tyler, Texas playing Video games. My parents 
    couldn't grasp the concept of playing 8 hours of Unreal Tournament, but they 
    don't know how fun it is. We had several people from the site there, plus a 
    couple that hadn't joined yet. Those that attended: Neo, Comter, JAD, UPS, 
    KD, Laura_Zeth, Pippin, Vimmington, jeff...and those that aren't part of the 
    site yet: Austin Deptula, Aldofo, and Adam. We had a blast, and I was kinda 
    sad to see that it was over when it was. They had to leave at 8:00-ish, but 
    I had planned to stay until 10:00. It's good that I didn't, because I was 
    really sleepy on the way home. Pippin is only 11 yrs old, and is freakin' 
    awesome at the game. Comter was always in the way with his snipe rifle, and 
    JAD was jumping around the screen like a psycho. Austin, on the other hand, 
    was just ready to cap you around the corner, and UPS runs around looking for 
    people to kill. Everyone else just shoots them as they see them.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Welp, it's getting 
    late now, and I still have to study for a test that is tomorrow night. I 
    think I will play one game of UT before I go to bed, and I will study 
    tomorrow all day. Later.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Man, I am tired. Sorry 
    about the once-a-week journal, for those that are actually reading it. But that 
    is about all the time I have left to do something like this. I have done a lot 
    of work on the site this past week, as most of you have seen. And there is still 
    more to come. I am working on archiving the journals right now, so that the 
    pages load quicker, and things stay in order.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I didn&#39;t work much this 
    week. But that was because of a schedule screw up on my bosses part. I needed 
    Friday off, and told him about a week in advance. Then before he posted the 
    schedule, I also left him a note to get Saturday off. He gives me both Friday 
    and Saturday nights on...exactly the opposite of what I requested. So, I had 
    to scramble to find someone to work Friday night for me since I had tickets 
    to the Rangers game (more on this later), and no one in the ENTIRE restaurant 
    would trade Saturday morning for Saturday night with me. I needed Saturday night 
    off because my dad got back from PA that night, and it was also my step-mom&#39;s 
    birthday. So we were going to go do something, and I still don&#39;t know what they 
    did entirely. They went out to eat or something, and then came back and had 
    cake and ice cream. Oh well, that&#39;s life.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Friday night. That was 
    an experience. I went to the Rangers v. Angels game at the Ballpark in Arlington. 
    With me was a girl in my computer class (the class that is a waste of my time) 
    who likes baseball. Great game. We were nearly hit by the ball 4 times, with 
    one landing two rows in front of me, but I couldn&#39;t get up in time to join in 
    the people catching it. I also think that I was on TV for that...but it was 
    a foul ball, so I don&#39;t know. Next time I will bring a poster that will do a 
    little advertising for the website and sit in a place where I could be on TV 
    all the time. Heh. Anyway, it was a no-stress &quot;date&quot; if you will...at least 
    it wasn&#39;t for me. I didn&#39;t plan to make any moves on her, and I didn&#39;t make 
    any moves on her. Hey, I didn&#39;t even know her age, or anything about her. But 
    I learned, and so did she about me. When the game was over, it ended quickly. 
    So we went to the movies and saw The Fighting Temptations (as posted in the 
    forums). It was a good show, and there was a lot of black humor and a lot of 
    music in it. I was also surprised that it didn&#39;t give churches too much of a 
    bad wrap, except for the hypocritical/gossiping stereotype that it kept reinforcing. 
    When it was over, she invited me to do things together again, and I will take 
    her up on it...if I can ever find a time when I am not in school or work. I 
    used to not have such a full schedule, but now my free time conflicts with everyone 
    else&#39;s so it&#39;s hard to have much of a social life. That&#39;s good I guess in some 
    respects. Anyway, the night ended in a hug (she initiated it) and I was happy 
    for that. No pressure.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Saturday I slept in until 
    about 12:30 and then got ready for work. I tried and tried to get off, but no. 
    I got to work at the same time as one of the other people that didn&#39;t want to 
    close because he was having a party. He managed to switch with someone. As the 
    night went on, things got worse - for him. See the way things work at the restaurant, 
    as far as those who get to leave first...is the people who work doubles go first, 
    then the 4:00-ers and then the 5:00-ers and then the closers. Well, when it 
    came time to list who gets cut first, he was last. Why? Because everyone that 
    came in was either a double or a 4:00-er. But he has a party...and a &quot;hurt&quot; 
    finger. He jammed his finger, doing who knows what, but hadn&#39;t complained about 
    it all night until he sees that he is not leaving until about 11:30 p.m. So 
    what do you do? Deal with it. No, but what does he do? Cries about it to the 
    managers. So they move him up to be 5th cut. That puts this girl I like down 
    to 6/7th cut, from 5/6th cut. Nope that is not good enough for him. He cries 
    some more. (and by crying, I mean complaining) He ends up being 1st cut. THAT 
    smurfs off a LOT of people. Everyone that worked that night got moved down one 
    cut, because this guy that looks like a tough football player, has a &quot;hurt&quot; 
    finger, and a party to go to. So needless to say, no one is going to be helping 
    him out with anything for a while.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">If living in a small country 
    town has taught me anything, it is to not smurf off one person, or you will 
    smurf off the whole town! He obviously doesn&#39;t know that. And it will be hard 
    for him to get anyone to do anything for him that worked that night. Good luck, 
    retard.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Anyway, I went back to 
    work today, and was put in the Party Room. I hate the party room. I always make 
    mistakes in there when they put the pressure on me. But I didn&#39;t today. I was 
    excited. I only forgot to get two salads as appetizers for a table. I made quite 
    a bit of money in tips. Then I got moved out to the floor, and put in a section 
    that I have never worked before. I did all right, and made all the people that 
    I waited on enjoy their meal and time at the restaurant. I then went to church 
    tonight, and didn&#39;t do anything afterward. I need some new friends that go and 
    do stuff. Tonight all I wanted to do was go to the Lineberry Lobby and hang 
    out with The Group from ETBU like the good&#39;ole days. Just chillin&#39; with college 
    students and not having to worry about dating or going places, or even holding 
    conversation for that matter. *sigh* I need to meet more people. I think it 
    is time to try other churches - big ones. (I am not really learning anything 
    from this one I go to now, but I go because it&#39;s better than not going.)</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After church, I felt like 
    a loser, and went to Braum&#39;s to get some ice cream and see how things were going 
    there. Apparently they got a new manager, some middle-aged woman named Nina, 
    and this other dude that looks pretty tough for an assistant. There are a couple 
    of decent looking white boys there now, and a few people that were there from 
    before I was, and some from before I left. Their 1/2 gallon ice creams went 
    up 8% and I wasn&#39;t going to pay that much for it. So, I just got a sundae (which 
    in reality costs more), but that&#39;s all I wanted.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Then I came home, contemplated 
    calling Brynn (the girl I mentioned before from BCIS) but didn&#39;t. I just played 
    some UT to brush up on my skills for Saturday...which reminds me that I need 
    to tell my parents that I am going to Tyler this weekend. I hope they don&#39;t 
    freak out about that. Anyway, that is all for tonight. I had planned on keeping 
    to my schedule, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen much. I&#39;ll try though.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Well, as far as school

    going to Spanish class though. One of the girls that sits next to me gave me 
    and some other people around some Rangers tickets. Mine are for Sept. 19th - 
    Rangers v. Angels. So I am taking a girl that I help out in BCIS class with 
    me. She was the next person that I saw that might like sports. (And considering 
    that I don&#39;t have hardly ANY guy friends, what am I to do, eh? Go with a guy 
    I don&#39;t know? That&#39;s just weird.)</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Work is going all right. 
    I haven&#39;t had to wait on a table (only booths) until tonight. I came into work 
    early, because I got ready early, and wasn&#39;t going to go back to bed, for fear 
    of not waking up. And when I got there, they asked me to clock in so they could 
    send some of the people home that wanted to go. I had no problem because that 
    is what I would hope someone would do if they were early. *sigh* When I clocked 
    in, I got a table of 11 people, a booth of 4 people, another booth with 1, another 
    booth with 1, another booth with 4, and some more booths - which went to the 
    girl that was ending the day shift! MAN!!! They had to send in 2 bar tenders, 
    and the girl that was working in the day had to stay late, and it just wouldn&#39;t 
    stop until about the time that the other people got there. Then we were slow 
    for the rest of the night. Dah well, I made $35 tonight, and I guess that is 
    good for it being as slow as it was.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I also was told (for the 
    last time) that I could not take orders with my Palm-Pilot. I think it is easier 
    than to use paper, and a pen that may not write sometimes, and the customers 
    think it is cool too. But the managers don&#39;t think it is cool, and one said 
    that he will throw it away next time he sees it. Can he do that? I dunno...something 
    about private property, but then again, I don&#39;t think it applies to private 
    businesses. Anyway, I won&#39;t bring it anymore *sigh*. Hey, it made some people 
    come back, and say &quot;I want to sit in Palm-boy&#39;s section...you know the one that 
    uses the Palm-Pilot to take orders.&quot; Well, this manager is one of two that don&#39;t 
    like it, and there are two that do. He&#39;s just a butt though. Strict about everything. 
    It saves paper, and saves me money.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">The girl that liked anime 
    that I worked with got fired...apparently they thought she wasn&#39;t able to perform 
    sufficiently. That makes me wonder if I am meeting standards or not. I hate 
    doing tables, especially multiple tables, because they are rude and just don&#39;t 
    understand how much work it is to deal with them, and other people that see 
    that I am clearly busy, but insist on calling me over - mid-order - to say they 
    want extra mayonnaise. Buck you, Fuddy! One moment please! Yes, I am a rebel 
    when it comes to being bossed, but I pretend that I don&#39;t care, and get them 
    what they need to get them out of my section, and I act nice about it, and pretend 
    that I am stupid - they think I am anyway, so it doesn&#39;t matter. I know that 
    I&#39;m probably smarter than they ever were at my age, and some of them I am still 
    smarter than today.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I have been extremely 
    busy with school, work, site development and public relations for the site. 
    Allow me to explain.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">School is pretty boring, 
    still. The only thing I look forward to are the nice looking girls that I see 
    each day. And there is about 1 or 2 that I am talking about that are in my classes. 
    Other than that, it&#39;s just going to school to get an easy A.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">As for work, it got pretty 
    hectic when the weekend rolls around and they put me in the party room. I have 
    discovered my limitations. I can hold &quot;3 booths and a table,&quot; &quot;4 booths,&quot; or 
    any amount of booths less than 4 alone. When I was in the party room, they gave 
    me 4 tables. That is enough seating for 32-36 people, which is too much for 
    my brain to comprehend when they are not in the same party. I have to juggle 
    when this one got their drinks, when this one is ready to order, when this one 
    is ready for their ticket, and none of them are sympathetic to me when they 
    see me taking drink orders for a table that was just sat, and interrupt me to 
    say they are ready to order...or when I am still bringing drinks to their table, 
    and the other half is ready for refills. It&#39;s crazy, and I can&#39;t do it. However, 
    since I worked a double shift on Saturday, I was given 3 booths in the morning, 
    and 2 booths to 3 booths and a table at night. I used this time to perfect the 
    art of tip making. I have learned the secrete to making $5 and $6 tips each 
    time (which is exactly what happened to me all day). So I made about $80 on 
    Friday, and $80 on Saturday.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Concerning the site development, 
    Benji and I have talked a little about the new Rants feature on the front page, 
    and have decided to get it going. I have also begun writing a Constitution for 
    the site to dictate the duties and abilities and positions of the forum and 
    website government. It is based on the US Constitution, and so far, I have 1 
    of 7 Articles completed. It&#39;s long. I will be redesigning the home page over 
    time, as I can find such time between homework and school and work.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Now for the Public Relations...one 
    night, I got bored and decided to go to MSN chat and see what they knew in Peer&#39;s 
    &gt; 20s &gt; Room 10. I met a girl Screen Named &quot;Faith,&quot; whose real name is Debbie, 
    who is a very lovely, friendly chatter. We still talk on IM a lot, and gang 
    up in chat rooms to strike up the most interesting conversations. She&#39;s from 
    Missouri, and is 20/single. I did an interview that night, following Benji&#39;s 
    form on The Benji Interviews from anime-kingdom.net with a guy named Moose_Of_Woe. 
    That was the scene that closed the deal. I really enjoyed doing the interview, 
    and in doing so, three people joined the website that night from the chat room...Poe, 
    Ashley, and someone else, that hasn&#39;t posted I don&#39;t think. Our site popularity 
    is picking up, though not as rapidly as I would like. But that is good, because 
    we are still not done yet with the site&#39;s development. My availability of time 
    is short, and my mood is not right for me to do too much with the design, or 
    it won&#39;t turn out properly.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">We do still have several 
    pages waiting to be deployed to the server. We&#39;re waiting though because we 
    don&#39;t have any content for things like the Radio station, etc. I also have to 
    redesign the logos for the online store items since they are not the proper 
    size for the shirts, which is one reason for the stagnation of the store.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Tonight I also sent Nikki, 
    and a new lizard that I caught, back into the wild. Nikki was about to die, 
    I guess because she wasn&#39;t eating anything. I recently caught the little one 
    outside the front door, and tonight I caught a pink one on my pink fireplace. 
    So I just decided to let all three of them go, and when I did, I saw two more 
    big ones outside in our flower bed, so I don&#39;t have to worry about finding them 
    again, or them surviving. That&#39;s all for tonight. More to come in a week or 
    so. Laterz.</font></b></p>
