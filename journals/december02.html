      <p align="left">That's what I get for writing in my journal too soon. 
      After I got done yesterday, I contemplated going to bed, or going to watch 
      Anastasia with the family. I went to watch TV. A few moments later, my 
      brother is sent out of the living room, and my sister was in here room, 
      and I received a lecture. &quot;What are your plans for the future?&quot;</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">I could have sworn we had been over this at least 5 times, 
      and not only that, my parents are the ones that changed my plans by 
      bringing me back here. Anyway, we covered the cost of going to TSTC, why I 
      seem to not be able to set goals, my driver's license, my &quot;girlfriend&quot; 
      (which <u>really</u> made me mad), ETBU, my friends, (which they proceeded 
      to insult), making a budget (which my step dad already has one made, they 
      just like to throw it back at me every now and then), and taking care of 
      my loans. I could scream!</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Anyway, the girlfriend thing...Amy, you didn't call back 
      yesterday. That doesn't look too good for you. You didn't call today, that 
      looks even worse. My parents made some kind of remark about my 
      &quot;girlfriend&quot; and I, once more, corrected them on that, any my step dad had 
      something to say about me, having a picture of a single girl (meaning only 
      one girl) on my desk, and she not being my &quot;girlfriend&quot;: We were DATING! - 
      dang... We didn't commit to boyfriend/girlfriend because of a number of 
      outstanding reasons...one of which being that I am HERE! (&lt;- this is the 
      little voice in my head screaming) Man, that made me feel bad and mad. Mad 
      because I cannot explain to him what Amy and I were, because there is not 
      a term for it other than &quot;dating.&quot; To tell him more than he needs to know 
      would only upset him more. Ugh...that would be the last thing I need. (but 
      I didn't mind our dates, and I thought they were fine.). They are totally 
      against me being social. Humph...I may come back to the subject of 
      Amy...but for now, I will move on, or I will be up all night...</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Insulting my friends is another thing that really upset 
      me. I have not had friends like the Group at ETBU. Never. Cracky called to 
      invite me to play cards when she came to Hubbard. When my mom asked who 
      was calling before she transferred the call to me, Cracky said &quot;This is 
      Amanda from ETBU.&quot; Now, I can picture Amanda saying that, not meaning 
      anything by it, only to be a lame-ish humor. My mom, however, took it as 
      her being snobby and stuck up. &quot;No wonder my son is a big head...he hangs 
      around people like that!&quot; she says. Well, the people she refers to 
      (without meeting them for herself) form the biggest group of Christian 
      friends on the campus of ETBU, accepting anyone and everyone just as they 
      are. So...needless to say, I was upset for the rest of the evening, which 
      ended after the lecture.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">This morning, I finally learned the paperwork for DQ. I 
      don't know why it took 2 1/2 years to learn something so easy. The first 
      manager I worked for was supposed to train me, then the second, third, and 
      finally the fourth one did, because I have the most seniority there except 
      for him (perhaps continual work experience is a better word).</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Well I worked all day, and was behind for most of it 
      because of learning something new before I was done with everything else. 
      As soon as we opened the doors, people came in and ordered food...that 
      doesn't happen too often, and it set me back too. I worked from 8:20 to 
      6:05 because the night shift leader called in sick. I sent Rita home 
      because she wasn't doing so hot, and Amanda's (the one that works at DQ, 
      not Cracky) grandfather died on Christmas Eve night, so she couldn't come 
      in and I called my brother in. I was pretty much beat when I got home.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">I worked on how much it would cost to go to TSTC in the 
      fall, and it is over $3000 for 4 years, including the fees and boos it is 
      probably around $4500 for the 2 years. That's pretty good. (hmm...I looked 
      up just now and saw Amy's picture smiling at me. It made me happy...
      <img border="0" src="../forum/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15"> .) I've 
      lost my train of though...oh, yeah. I can now start all over with my 
      degree...if I want. What I want to do really is become a robo-physicist, 
      and design/work with robots. But I don't know how feasible that is. I have 
      wanted to do that since last summer, after reading a 600 pg collection of 
      short stories by Isaac Asimov called &quot;Machines that Think.&quot; It's a good 
      book. I read every story. We'll see how that goes this fall though.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Back to Amy. What I am going to do is give her the rest of 
      the week, until next Wednesday, maybe even Friday, to call. I will include 
      a statement in the letter I have got mostly written about this matter, 
      since she will not see this journal until the fall on the internet (as you 
      see it now). I am going to send a picture I drew, for her, and I will work 
      on a poem for my next letter. Hopefully she will write back, and/or come 
      see me on the 20th of January or before. I miss her, really, but what my 
      parents said cut deep, as well as them pointing out all the negative 
      aspects of a girl not calling back. I can see it their way, but they can't 
      see it mine. Perhaps the number in her cell phone is not my number, since 
      I used a calling card to place the call. Therefore she can't call me 
      back...unless she re-reads my email that has my phone number on it. But I 
      could be wrong. She could have fallen for Mike...(Who's Mike?) Most likely 
      he is just an older college guy that all the girls fall for, so he doesn't 
      really care that she may (or may not) like him...he's just doing it to 
      pass the time until he can find someone better...for him.</p>

    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">It's Christmas Day! But it felt just like any other day. 
      We did the presents this morning, as always, but I didn't know what time 
      we were doing them for sure.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Around 5:00, I kept waking up and couldn't sleep for 
      nothing. So I laid there and tried to think of what my parents could have 
      possibly gotten me since they didn't get me walkie-talkies like I asked 
      for. All I could think of would be stuff that I would use later in life, 
      but nothing in particular came to mind. They wouldn't buy me computer 
      stuff because they don't want to support my &quot;addiction&quot; as they put it, 
      and they won't buy me electronic stuff, because they don't want me to have 
      fun and stay in my room all the time, and that wouldn't help me later in 
      life. So, thinking all this got me a little depressed, then I remembered 
      Amy was going to call me today.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Christmas is a family day. So I felt real special 
      yesterday when she said she would call me. We could talk more and I would 
      have a much better day after hearing her voice. So with that, I went back 
      to sleep.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Around 7:40, when my alarm went off, I woke up and 
      listened to the Christmas music on the radio station t was set to. It was 
      the same old songs they play every year, so I didn't care too much about 
      listening to them. I just thought of how I wish I could relay them to 
      someone special, and get the same loving response in return, like the 
      writers did. I did that for about 30 minutes and turned it off when the 
      commercials came on. Then I went back to sleep until 8:20.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">My mom came in,&quot; I hope you are getting dressed!&quot; Nope, I 
      was still in bed. So I got up and got dressed, then went to the living 
      room about 8:25 to eat some cranberry bread, poppy seed bread, and banana 
      bread. My sister was reading the Christmas Story book. We then opened 
      presents.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">From my sister, I got two hand-drawn pictures. From my 
      parents I got some anti-freeze windshield wiper fluid, slippers, water 
      shoes, some Teflon pots and pans, and a dinnerware set for when I move 
      out. Can't use anything but the slippers right now, so I did.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">When we were done with gifts, I worked on my brother's 
      computer. No luck there. For the past two years now, I have built a 
      computer for my brother. The first one he had the mother board burnt out, 
      so I took my old one and built one for him. He then proceeded to screw 
      that one up , so now he has a new shell, and my step dad just put the old 
      parts into it. It doesn't work. It won't read for the CD-ROM, or 
      something, but I was able to clear the hard drive. Now it is just a piece 
      of hardware.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">I got my speaker to work that I got from Josh Jordan, but 
      now it doesn't, and my CD player is still screwing up. Dah well.... After 
      all that, I went driving.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Today I worked on left and right turns, parallel parking, 
      and hills, as well as testing my anti-lock breaks. Afterward, I took a 
      nap. I was beat. It was about the time Amy was supposed to call, so I told 
      my mom that I would take the call. However, my mom then decided to get on 
      the Internet when it was even closer to the time that she was most likely 
      to call. Grr...Amy's a smart girl, she'll call back if it is busy. I hope
      <img border="0" src="../forum/images/smiles/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15"> .</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">My parents still insist on referring to her as my 
      girlfriend, even though they know better, when ever they talk to me about 
      her. I don't mind so much; I would be thrilled to have her as my 
      girlfriend, however there's a lack of commitment from one side or the 
      other. (But I'm game for it
      <img border="0" src="../forum/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15"> .) I just 
      can't see how the guys that turned her down did so. She's a sweet, funny, 
      spontaneous, smart, cute, and pretty (not the same thing) girl. I guess 
      they think they can do better, or want a toy to play with.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Well, we watched Big Mama's House (it was the first time 
      my parent's have seen it), and they liked it. (Amy still hasn't called.) 
      And since that was over I decided to write my journal. It's 7:21 p.m., and 
      she still has 2 hours to call. Hopefully she will. Hopefully she has just 
      gone out of town and will call me when she gets back. Hopefully, she will 
      call me tomorrow if it is too late tonight. Hopefully...</p>

      <p align="left">Christmas Eve!...but it doesn't feel any different to me 
      than any other day.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">I went to work this morning at 8:20. It's a little later 
      than yesterday, but for the past two days now Steve has called right at 
      8:30. So I have to be there early. I was supposed to do the paperwork and 
      count the food for the week today, but he and his wife got there early to 
      do it. Dah well...he says he will do the paper work on Thursday. (Among 
      other things that are supposed to get done by the end of the week.)</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">I worked with Rita and Tom today. Of all the complaining 
      and belly aching that I have heard from the other employees, she is not so 
      bad. Maybe it was just because she was seeing how I work. Anyway, for the 
      most part we were slow today, but we had more business than the other DQ's 
      around.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">I got off at 3:00, but folks were still inside, so we 
      couldn't lock up and clean everything until the left. No big deal...i got 
      a $3 tip from them - so I was happy. We didn't get out of there until 
      3:45, and then I had to go to the bank. So I wasn't done with DQ until 
      about 3:55. (But I forgot to clock out. I'll do it Thursday morning.)</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">When I got home, the first thing I did was call Amy. I was 
      so excited to talk to her...but she was watching a movie with her brother, 
      Bart...and Mike. MIKE?! What's the deal? That is a little discomforting. 
      But I will get to that later. I had made out a list to talk to her about 
      so that we would not have a dead conversation (as often happens with me on 
      the phone...that is why I hate using the phone - everything is in 
      real-time, and you expire all your material real quick.) It's ok though, 
      she told me she sent an email to me, even though I won't be able to read 
      it until the fall. But it's the sentiment that matters to me. Hearing her 
      voice was almost enough to make me &quot;have a moment,&quot; and I dang near cried 
      twice (as did she). She started it though...which is good - it means that 
      she misses me as much as I miss her...that's quite a bit.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">But the kicker...if she misses me, then what's the deal 
      with Mike? Old friend? New friend? Boyfriend? Relative? I just hope she 
      hasn't given up on me completely. There has to be a thought somewhere in 
      the back of her mind that tells her...&quot;he'll be back. I know he 
      will...he's always there when I least expect it, but it's really when I 
      most need it...MAN where is he?&quot; Well, the answer...&quot;I'm right here...for 
      now it's only a phone call away (or a 2 hour drive). But soon, it will be 
      right there.&quot; I told her I would try to visit. And now with my new car, 
      and soon to be had driver's license, with the permission of my parents, I 
      can visit. Ugh...I can write a bunch more on this but I will wait.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">She said she would call back tomorrow...hopefully she 
      will. (I have noticed how I always call or visit at a time when she is 
      about to do something that I would not like so much...or maybe it is just 
      my imagination.) Ugh...I didn't wait very long. Anyways.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Cracky visited me at the DQ today, about 40 minutes before 
      we closed. It was great to see her, some familiar face from The Group of 
      people I miss the most (and that is a darn big group). She got lunch - a 
      Steak Finger basket, 4 pcs. and no drink. I was going to make it for her, 
      but everybody and their mother came in after she did, so I didn't get a 
      chance. I told her the Group could visit - that I got the OK with my 
      parents, which was a shocker.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">But back to Christmas Eve. Every year, no matter where I 
      am at...It's a wonderful Life comes on and one of my parents watches it. I 
      have concluded that I have only seen about the first hour of that long, 
      semi-boring movie. Perhaps it is not so boring, it's just that I have 
      heard about the complaints of it being on every year, and seeing the first 
      part over and over again. (I have spent the last 30 minutes writing this 
      (by hand) so far).</p>
    </div>

      I just want to go to bed and listen to music, and think of Amy. According 
      to her and her roommate, I always made her happy. I guess I never told her 
      that she made my happy. (Even though she didn't jump but twice at 
      something I wanted us to do, but I jumped at everything she wanted to 
      do.)It's ok, I was there for her, and I had other friends that were there 
      for me. It all worked out - &quot;if only she knew&quot; - Michelle Branch. I'm 
      outty. Laterz.</p>

      <p align="left">Today was my first day back at work. I finally get rid of 
      8:00 classes to gain 8:30 work. It was pretty hectic today. Everything has 
      been moved around since I was there last, and I worked with two people 
      that I had not worked with before. The cook, Tom, resembled, to me at 
      least, a good-'ole country boy. He had a scraggly beard, a slow twang in 
      his speech, and was laid back about things. The other person was a girl, 
      Tanya. She is a Jehovah's Witness, with lengthy brown hair, and a cute 
      smile. (Nothing compared to Amy though, nothing by far.) She's kinda lazy 
      and has an attitude about things.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">It was kinda stressful today. I cleaned up the stuff that 
      was bothering my boss; the stuff that nobody &quot;had time to do.&quot; It didn't 
      take but 10-15 minutes at most. They are just lazy. Anyway my feet hurt 
      from standing all day.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">When I got home, I was excited to see that I had gotten 
      two letters! One was from a girl, Kim, that I met when I went to my friend 
      Jay's church. She sent me a Christmas card. The other was from my 
      ex-girlfriend from 7th grade - who is still one of my long-distance 
      friends. She and I have been writing on and off for the past 7 years. The 
      last time we had written was before I left for ETBU. I told her that I 
      would send her my address and phone number, but I never did. The email she 
      gave me didn't go to her. I don't know who's it was because they weren't 
      very helpful when telling me &quot;I don't know a Natalie <u>or</u> a Chris.&quot; 
      Poop on them.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Anyway, Natalie is doing fine. She's still dating the same 
      guy she was when we last talked and is going for a business administration 
      degree at UTA in Arlington.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Well, today was my sister's birthday. She is now 14. She 
      got a DataGirl electronic note pad, slippers, and hair things. Amanda 
      (a.k.a. &quot;Cracky&quot;) from ETBU was in town today, and invited me to come play 
      cards with her at her Grandmother's house. At first my parents (or my mom) 
      agreed, and then we told my step dad - &quot;No, you need to stay home and 
      spend time with your sister on her birthday,&quot; he said. The freakin' thing 
      lasted 15 MINUTES! I mean COME ON! It wasn't that big a deal to me, and I 
      wouldn't dare if anyone was there on my birthday or not. Grr. So I had to 
      cancel on Amanda. She is going to come to the DQ tomorrow for lunch.</p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">Tomorrow is Christmas Eve. I am gonig to call Amy (and 
      hopefully surprise her) around 3:30 when I get back from work (and 
      hopefully before she gets to work). I still miss her as much as always. If 
      I could have one more date...well, a bunch more dates, it would be so 
      awesome. *sigh* I am going to bed now. Laterz.</p>

      <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Well, today has been a generally 
      uneventful and boring day. We went to church this morning. Here lately, my 
      parents have been going to the United Methodist Church here in town. So I 
      went. I did not like it one bit. They are all about responsive readings 
      (which I suppose are to represent the people's response to what God is 
      telling them through the priest, or at least that's that it appeared to be 
      to me) which I don't like. They also are very repetitious with reading; 
      they had an Old Testament reading, Epistle reading, New Testament (Gospel) 
      reading, and finally the sermon. In between everything we either sang or 
      did a responsive reading. Then the preaching was boring, and I almost fell 
      asleep every two minutes. My mind kept wandering back to the church at 
      ETBU and why didn't I ever go to church with Amy, and how I would much 
      rather be in Chapel than here. (At least then I would be with people I 
      like to be with.).</font></b></p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Well, that morning I figured we would 
      eat right after church, so I skipped breakfast. It turned out we didn't 
      eat until 3:00 - 3:13 p.m. So then I was starving, and when I chow down on 
      my food, my parents get on to me that I am eating too fast. I mean, come 
      on! My goodness! I told them that I was hungry, and when I tried to eat a 
      BANANA 30-45 minutes before lunch, they say &quot;no, lunch is almost ready.&quot; 
      Ugh! But no matter. I am full now. We are about to go to a fellowship 
      thing at the church. Not something I am looking forward to. I don't 
      particularly care to deal with anybody in this town asking me about school 
      or life in general...because I just might tell them.</b></font></p>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>I started my letter to Amy today. I like 
      to write over a couple days (unless I am in a bind) so that there is 
      personality and content in my letters. I also have her picture that I 
      promised I would draw. I really miss her (and I am sure having her picture 
      on my desk at eye-level doesn't help matters much, but she is a &quot;good 
      distraction&quot;.).</b></font></p>

    <div align="center">
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>I am almost done unpacking. I just have 
      a little bit of stuff on my bed. My mom and I keep going at it about where 
      things can and can't go in my room. It is MY room, and she is concerned 
      how things look. WHO CARES?! Nobody comes over and nobody see my room but 
      me and my brother...or who ever else passes through my room to get to out 
      gas heater. Ugh! Frustration. I am sleepy, but I can't take a nap because 
      we have a sleeping schedule here: 10:00 p.m. - 8:00 a.m. unless working.</b></font></p>

      Tonight she went to take her food/shorthand test at Outback. I hope she 
      did well If she studied, then I know she could do well. Ugh...I heard a 
      commercial for Outback and thought of her...i can't do anything that 
      doesn't remind me of her. Even if I sit with my legs folded in a 
      &quot;4-shape&quot;, my hand rests on my foot, and that is when we would hold hands. 
      *sigh* I wonder if she is thinking of me as much? According to her 
      roommate, she did when she was at school. She liked me a lot more than she 
      let me know. That, once I knew it, made it even harder to leave Friday. 
      She cried, and I almost cried when I saw her off. Had I said anymore to 
      her, I would have. I was fighting it back heavy.</b></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>After that, we went to the Ford 
      Dealership here in town and I got a silver 2000 Chevy Cavalier, with black 
      fabric interior. It's awesome. We went and drove it around a while. The 
      trouble for now is that paying for it almost broke me, and would have if 
      it weren't for my RA check. And the fact that I don't have my license yet 
      doesn't help either. But we did establish some rules, which gives me a 
      little more freedom from my &quot;two-year punishment&quot; (leaving ETBU). I can go 
      anywhere, keeping in mind gas cost, and I have to be back by 10:00 p.m. 
      and tell my parents when I leave and am supposed to be back. I can also 
      have friends over, I found out today. What a shocker! But only one or two 
      at a time. They can even spend the night! But I have to tell my parents in

      not paying &quot;apartment rent&quot; so I can't treat it like an apartment. That's
