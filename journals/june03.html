      I convinced Chris to let me do his journal today.....CRAZY CHRIS called me 
      at 9:15 this morning to wake me up to go to church with him....but by the 
      time he got there he was disappointed to find that I hadn&#39;t found an &quot;appropriate&quot; 
      shirt to wear yet....so he picked one out for me (that I hated) but we went 
      to church anyway...(relatively new experience for me) and it wasn&#39;t half bad....</em></font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><em>After church we decided to come 
      back to his house which didn&#39;t last long cause I convinced him to go to my 
      house and we watched &quot;The Three Ninjas&quot; THE BEST MOVIE EVER...but I fell asleep 
      cause he woke me up so early in the morning....and we ate Braum&#39;s Cookies-n-Cream

      did...and then after we hung out with some people from the church...I wish

    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Ok, this is how it <em>really</em> 
    went...</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Last night I told Stacy that she was 
    going to church with me in the morning, and that it started at 10:50, and I 
    was coming to her house at 10:15...so she needs to wake up accordingly. She 
    said, ok so that means that I have to wake up at 9:15...since I don&#39;t have an 
    alarm you will have to call me. And so I did, at 9:15 on the dot.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">When I got to her house, she was still 
    deciding on what shirt to wear - I mean, she has a million and they were all 
    over her bathroom floor, and she couldn&#39;t find just one? Come on...so I picked 
    out a shirt, and we left. When we got to church there weren&#39;t many people, but 
    there was a substantial amount of youth there for a Sunday morning (at least 
    compared to the last Sunday morning that I went when the youth minister resigned).</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">After Church we went back to my house 
    to get something to eat. I was going to cook some stuffing and some chicken 
    or meat or something, but my dad got on to me and suddenly I wasn&#39;t very hungry 
    after it. I don&#39;t understand why I couldn&#39;t cook some of those things...no one 
    else in my house cooks but me if I feel like it...everyone else is either at 
    work, or too tired to cook something major like that during the week. Anyway, 
    I ended up eating just a couple sandwiches and some chips and chewy chocolate 
    chip cookies. When I had finished my lunch, Stacy wanted to change out of the 
    shirt I had picked out, because it was long sleeve, so we went back to her house, 
    and there we say Lauren&#39;s new boyfriend, Clay.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I must say that when Stacy and I had 
    talked about him over the phone, he seemed like a loser, but I met with him 
    and he has a friendly personality. However, after spending the day with him, 
    and hearing some of the things that goes on in his life, I can&#39;t say that I 
    like him much. He is kind of strange...like eery strange. Anyway, Lauren will 
    listen to me one of these days, until then, she will just learn the hard way.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">We watched 3 Ninjas while we were there, 
    because it came on TV, and after that we left to come back to my house to do 
    homework. While I read for my Brit Lit class, Stacy got a hold of my journals 
    on my computer, so I told her how to navigate throughout the site on my computer, 
    since I wasn&#39;t online, and she read nearly everything that had happened to me 
    from the time I started the website, until my latest journal entry.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Natalie called about this time wondering 
    if I was going to come to church tonight, but I hadn&#39;t planned on it. However, 
    since I had Stacy with me, and she wanted to meet Stacy officially, I decided 
    to go ahead and go. The sermon would be boring tonight, since it was a character 
    analysis of Isaac. So unfortunately, I started nodding while I was listening 
    to the sermon. It was so embarrassing...but I remedied it with some Breath strips. 
    They have a potent bite to them, so I put two in my mouth and chewed them into 
    my chewing gum. That kept me awake. Natalie and Stacy also met tonight. It was 
    nothing spectacular. I did feel a little self-conscious about putting my arm 
    around Stacy since Natalie<em> was </em>sitting right behind me. But I did it, 
    and it didn&#39;t matter.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Natalie invited us to go to her house 
    and go swimming after church. I totally forgot that she had a swimming pool...however, 
    Stacy doesn&#39;t like to get in a bathing suit. So I told Natalie that, and that 
    I would come on a night that Stacy was working. She was cool with it. So Stacy 
    and I went with the preacher&#39;s daughter, and some other kids to Wendy&#39;s and 
    then to the park to have a picnic. We played on the swings and with a football, 
    until the mosquitoes kept eating at me. So we left, and headed back to my house 
    to, once again, try to do homework. But that didn&#39;t happen too much.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">In Brit Lit, we are reading all kinds 
    of poems and I am not too up on deciphering what the poet is talking about so 
    I just put them aside, and read my journal with Stacy. She thought it was sweet 
    and interesting. The fact that she thought it was interesting, was interesting 
    to me. I always considered my life to be boring and generally uneventful. However, 
    the people that I talk to really enjoy reading my journal entries. I just simply 
    don&#39;t have the time to do everything that I want to in the day. So I just update 
    it now when I have the chance.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I took her home, and then called her 
    and talked until I fell asleep. So I guess I will do my homework in the morning. 
    Laterz.</font></b></p>

    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Hey Guys,</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I am sorry that I haven&#39;t updated my 
    journal in about 20 days. I have been really busy. But I have found a free moment 
    to do it now, so I will. Let&#39;s see...what have I been up to?</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Stacy and I are still together, and 
    going strong. We celebrated our 1 month anniversary on the 11th, and that went 
    well...it was a hectic time since that was the same weekend as my birthday, 
    my dad&#39;s birthday, and Father&#39;s Day.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I started school at TCC on the 2nd 
    of June, and am taking British Literature and US History Pt. 2. They both require 
    a lot of reading, and I didn&#39;t even consider that before I signed up for them. 
    So, needless to say, my schedule was in a crunch. I told my boss at Braum&#39;s 
    that I needed time to be able to study. So they put me on the schedule 6 days 
    a week, every night. I had a test at the end of that work schedule, and I couldn&#39;t 
    take them doing what they were doing to me anymore. So I quit. It seemed to 
    me that they were going to string me along like Dairy Queen did with the whole 
    &quot;Assistant Manager&quot; job. I was about to be promoted by the District Manager, 
    and then we got a new General Manager, and he said that I had to prove it to 
    him before I could be promoted. &quot;Puh! I had already proved it to YOUR boss, 
    why do I need to prove it to you?&quot; So, that Monday night, the day before my 
    test, I quit.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Lauren had also quit a couple days 
    before that, because she couldn&#39;t take the job anymore either. So that leaves 
    Stacy there by herself. She wanted to quit too because there was nothing there 
    left for her to look forward to at work. She tried to find a job at a drug store, 
    but they messed her around on the applications, telling her they would be in, 
    and then saying, &quot;Oh, we aren&#39;t hiring right now...&quot; Butt holes!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I got my palm pilot finally on the 
    5th. It has been the neatest thing ever. The only problem that I have with it 
    is that I can&#39;t connect to the internet with my $100 modem card that I bought 
    for it. I don&#39;t know if it is the cable or the card, or I just don&#39;t have the 
    right phone number for a dial-up connection. But I have been taking it every 
    where I go, and I take notes on it at school now.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I got my computers now, and had to 
    spend a good 4 days fixing my XP computer. I have found out that the A: drive 
    doesn&#39;t work on the one that I got from Dairy Queen, and neither does the modem. 
    But those are easily fixable, since I believe I have an extra one of each of 
    those somewhere...I just have to get them put in the right way. I seem to have 
    a problem adding hardware to my computer. It just doesn&#39;t work properly.
    </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Well, that is about all that has happened 
    to me. I am going to apply at a Diary Queen in Arlington tomorrow morning. I 
    should have no problem getting a job, except that they aren&#39;t hiring. So I will 
    really have to sell myself, with the fact that I have managed my own before, 
    and still have all the uniforms, and am already trained. So I would be an easy 
    hire, and a good choice for the job that they don&#39;t know they need filled. I 
    am also going to go to the mall and apply at some clothing stores. I want a 
    full-time job, because I am used to the big paychecks, but I don&#39;t have time 
    for one. I don&#39;t really even want to go to school, I am just doing it so I can 
    put off paying for my student loans so soon. Oh well...I know that I should 
    be going to school and get an education so that I can make more money later, 
    and do the things that I have planned for me to do.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Now that I have found some &quot;free time&quot; 
    - yeah, right - I am going to do a little work on the site. I have added new 
    music to the home page - it is .wma files, so that is windows media audio. I 
    don&#39;t know how well it will work with y&#39;all who do have windows, or for people 
    using Netscape, etc. But if it doesn&#39;t, then great, it will probably load faster. 
    If you have any problems with it, then put a message in the forums about it.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">I also regret to inform everyone that 
    the Freeform Frog store will not be opening so soon...if at all, because of 
    the finances required to run the store. When they started it, it was entirely 
    free, but now they are charging a percentage of the sales, and I don&#39;t know 
    if I want to invest that money (that I don&#39;t have, by the way) into something 
    that may or may not go over so well.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">So that is all for tonight. I will 
    try to get this updated, at least every other day from now on, and thus the 
    archives will be monthly, not biweekly. Laterz.</font></b></p>
