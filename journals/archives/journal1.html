        <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana" size="2">This morning, I woke up 
        late, at about 8:45, and was supposed to call Stacy at 8:30. She had 
        been awake since 7:00 this morning, and just didn't get out of bed until 
        8:30 or so. So, I went to her house to get her about 9:15, and brought 
        her back to my house.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana" size="2">When we got there, I 
        didn't want to clean my room...I wanted to sit with her and spend time 
        with her. So we did, and we played around some, until my dad came up to 
        check on us, and was a little disappointed that we didn't get anything 
        done in my room, as far as moving my things in. So I put together a 
        shelf and put my software on it, as well as my music.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana" size="2">We worked for about 30 
        minutes, or so, and then we went to the park for a spontaneous picnic. 
        We had some of the cold cuts from the weekend, and some sodas. It was a 
        nice day out, except for the fact that it got humid when it didn't rain, 
        and just sprinkled. So we only stayed at the park for a little bit - 
        primarily because I told my parents a time that I would be back, and 
        because I had to go to work, with enough time to drop her off at her 
        house on the way.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana" size="2">At work tonight, I was 
        Amber's runner...and I will never again fill that position. She was 
        doing well with getting the orders accurate on the screen, but I noticed 
        that she was having trouble with putting some of the specifics on there 
        so that I could make it like the people wanted. So, I told her &quot;I hope 
        you are putting them on there right, so I don't have to make them 
        again...&quot; And she said, &quot;I hope you are reading them right.&quot; And from 
        that point on, she left out several specifics for the orders that caused 
        me a lot of problems, especially since the vanilla ice cream, which is 
        in just about everything, was rock hard. It as terrible tonight...but 
        now that I am home, I feel better, because I can rest.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana" size="2">I called Stacy tonight, 
        and her phone died after a 20 minute conversation. It's ok though, 
        because she needs to sleep, as well as I do. I also looked at my 
        computer, and it stopped at 35% for the formatting, and said &quot;Disk not 
        ready. Formatting Terminated.&quot; Stupid homosexual computer. I told it it 
        had better get past 35% by the time I got home tonight (it was at 32% at 
        that time)...and it stops right on 35%. Crazy thing. I am restarting the 
        format, to see what happens, and hopefully it will work, or go through 
        the stuff it has already done a lot quicker.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Verdana" size="2">That's all for tonight. I 
        have to go to work tomorrow morning, so I am going to bed early tonight. 
        Laterz.</font></b></p>
