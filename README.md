the-spot.net v2

Description
====
This is a historical repository of the second version of the-spot.net I created.

Purpose
====
The move from version 1 to version 2 was to extend the functionality beyond a single-person
website that happened to have forums, and integrate some third-party content into the pages.
For example, a news & search widget from msnbc was put on the homepage as well as several links
to various parts of the forums. A new venture into ecommerce was also added as FreeFormFrog.

Editing and Commits
====
There is nothing to edit and commit to this, except for maybe the odd update from my end
as the creator.
